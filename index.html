                                Most of us might have heard the buzz around the word "data" which is everywhere, it is becoming such a huge deal. <strong> Data Science</strong>, <strong>Artificial
                                    Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Cloud
                                    Computing</strong>, <strong>Data Analytics</strong>, and the ever-elusive term Data Science is one term which rules them all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What is Data Science? Data science is one of the four paradigms of science. The other three are empirical, computational, theoretical, and then is Data Science which is the fourth aspect of science. We can say that Data Science is multi-dimensional which
                                uses the concepts like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics. The approach to solving the problems and how you figure out the solutions matters a lot in Data Science. Data Science is for everybody curious
                                to solve problems, co-relate the data, understand the algorithms.

                                With the continuous development in science and technology, it is hard to estimate how far and what else we will be able to establish. According to experts, the future of the world seems to be dominated by Artificial Intelligence. Talking about Artificial
                                Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It is a field of study which tries to make computers smarter. Artificial Intelligence has been used in almost every sector.
                                It is probably the fastest-growing development in the world of Technology and Innovation. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to greatly improve human life.

                                The first thing which strikes into our mind when we think of applications of artificial intelligence is Robotics. So the picture you can see aside is of Asimo which is a humanoid robot that can stimulate the motions of the human body. This robot works
                                on the principle of Prediction Movement Control System and is one example of Artificial Intelligence.

                                There are many technologies in AI which include: Natural Language Generation which converts text into data and helps the system to communicate ideas and thoughts as clearly as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Speech Recognition is used to convert and transform human speech into a useful and comprehensive format for computer applications to process for example, Alexa.
                            </p>

                                Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the functioning of corporate processes due to mimicking human tasks and automating them. It also reduces chunks of time.
                            </p>

                                To talk about the tools, there are numerous tools used in AI which include ScikitLearn, PyTorch, Theano, TensorFlow, Keras.

                                Now let us move towards Machine Learning, What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that identifies, generates, discriminates, and understands patterns of relations. Machine Learning is divided into four types which
                                include, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning, and Reinforcement. Machine Learning is the science of teaching machines how to learn by themselves? Well- it has a lot of benefits. Let us understand
                                it with an example if there's a task of cleaning the floor. Humans can do this task, but it will consume a lot of time, energy and the human will get bored as well. But if we teach the machines how to clean the floor, they
                                can do it far better than us without getting tired and bored!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even Walmart uses AI and Machine Learning. Walmart hopes to improve the customer experience with the new retail tech is through Scan and Go Shopping. Let us have a look at a few examples where we use the outcome of machine learning already:

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To sum it up, Data Science- Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning look all set to be the future of the world. Experts believe AI, ML would certainly become a part and parcel of human life soon and would completely change the way we view our world.
                                With Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the future seems intriguing and exciting.
